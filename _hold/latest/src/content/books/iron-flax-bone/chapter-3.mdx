Magic in Pentola is known as the Craft and those who dedicate themselves to it as Crafters.

## Dweomers

</Clip>

Dweomers are the formulae by which Pentolans apply magic onto their world.
You may apply any dweomer you have a copy of slowly, in a ritual, taking 10 minutes per magnitude.

If you are _familiar_ with a dweomer, you may attempt to apply it from memory.
If applying it as an _action_, make a **Flax** test;
if a hostile creature or person is close to you, test with disadvantage.

Whether or not you're _familiar_ with a dweomer, you may try to apply it as a _ritual_, provided you have a copy of it on you.
If applying it as a _ritual_, make a **Flax** test with advantage.

Start play with any one dweomer memorized.

## Magic Items

</Clip>

Magic items are as common as masterwork items in Pentola _because_ they're the same thingâ€”a true artisan can't help but make magic items when they do their work.

Mostly magic items do not have direct numeric impacts on the game, though they absolutely do have weird or interesting effects and/or count you as being familiar for one or more tasks.

### Matrices

</Clip>

One way to apply a dweomer as an action more reliably is to use a _matrix_, a special device for applying a specific dweomer.

Each matrix has it's own rating between `2-12`.
This rating is only for the purposes of opposed tests;
they are always automatically successful at applying a dweomer.
After each use, roll a `d12`;
unless the result is _over_ the matrix's rating, reduce its rating by one.
