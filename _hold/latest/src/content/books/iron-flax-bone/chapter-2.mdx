## Characteristics

</Clip>

- **Iron** represents force of will, presence, and metaphysical aptitude.
- **Flax** represents mental prowess and training, including knowledge and intuition.
- **Bone** represents physical prowess and training, including strength, agility, toughness, etc.

Characteristics may never rise above `12`, any overage is wasted/ineffective.

At creation, distribute 20 points between your three stats, none of which can start lower than 3 or higher than 8.

## Familiarities

</Clip>

Characters who are _familiar_ with something related to a particular task roll with advantage when trying it.
They might be familiar with Medicine, the Gondolieri, Whittling, the Tideriser District, the _Web_ [dweomer](), or anything else.

At creation, choose 6 familiarities.

<!-- TODO: Random familiarity selector -->

<Clip id="items">

## Items

</Clip>

You can _carry_ up to 12 items but keep as many as you please wherever you consider safe.

At creation, choose any six items between tools, kits, weapons, and armor.

<!-- TODO: Random equipment selector -->

<Clip id="tools">

### Tools

</Clip>

Tools assist in performing specific tasks.
Without them, some tasks can only be tried at disadvantage or maybe even not at all.
Particularly excellent tools may grant advantage at a task.

Some items perform the action themselves (such as [using a matrix]() to apply a [dweomer](../3#section-dweomers)) and have their own rating.
In these cases, roll against the item's rating to determine success instead of the character's characteristic.

<Clip id="kits">

### Kits

</Clip>

Kits are consumable items needed for a broad set of tasks—herbalism, medicine, spelunking, etc—any time you need a consumable related to the kit, you have it.
Mark next to your kit after each use.
Kits always start with `12` uses.

<!-- TODO: Kit list -->

<Clip id="weapons">

### Weapons

</Clip>

Successfully attacking someone with your weapon inflicts a hit—different enemies can sustain one or more hits.
Unless they're [magic](), weapons are treated as basically the same except where there's in-fiction differences that are meaningful (eg, reach with a spear or axes being more useful at chopping into doors).

<!-- TODO: Weapon list -->

<Clip id="armo">

### Armor

</Clip>

If wearing armor, roll a `d12` whenever you are hit (except if the hit was a _triumph_):

- Light armor saves you from a hit on a `4`, `8`, or `12`.
- Medium armor saves you from a hit on a `3`, `6`, `9`, or `12`.
- Heavy armor saves you from a hit on any even number.

<!-- TODO: Armor list -->

<Clip id="ambitions">

## Ambitions

</Clip>
At the beginning of play, choose one ambition your character is driven to fulfill.
You may have up to two active ambitions at any time.

Whenever you complete an ambition, add one familiarity which you gained in the service of that ambition.
