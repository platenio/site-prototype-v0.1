# Iron, Flax, & Bone

_Pentola is a highly lethal world where what you believe and do is what you become.
Explore a city of incredible magic and unending intrigue above catacombs filled with ancient horrors
locked away before an apocalypse hundreds of years in the past.
Take power, become rich, explore the lost city, or sing away the demons from your gondola._

**In Pentola, you are what you choose to become.**

_Iron, Flax, & Bone_ is a lightweight tabletop rpg that requires one twelve-sided die (a d12), a writing utensil, these rules, and a couple friends.

One player is the referee (ref): they facilitate the game and take on running the world.
