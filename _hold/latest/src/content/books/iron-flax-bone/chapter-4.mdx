## Tests, Intent & Approach

</Clip>

1. The player declares their character's _intent_—what outcome they want from their action.
2. Once the _intent_ is known, the player must explain their character's _approach_—how thecharacter will attempt to realize their _intent_ through action.
3. Once the _intent_ and _approach_ are known the ref is then—and **only then**—able to adjudicate the action, deciding first if a test is necessary, then which characteristic is most relevant based on the _intent_ and _approach_.
   A test is necessary only under the following conditions:
   1. The action as defined by the _intent_ and _approach_ together **can fail**.
   1. The action as defined by the _intent_ and _approach_ together **can succeed**.
   1. Failure has **meaningful consequences**.

When a test is called for, the player should roll a `d12` against the specified characteristic:

- A result lower than the characteristic is a _success_.
- A result equal to the characteristic is a _triumph_.
- A result above the characteristic is a _failure_.

For especially easy or hard tasks, the ref may impose advantage or disadvantage on the roll;
in which case, roll twice and take the _better_ result or _worse_ result respectively.

A character may aid or interfere with another character’s test, granting advantage or imposing disadvantage respectively.

When two or more characters oppose each other, such as in an argument, all roll.
The character that **rolls highest without failing wins**.
If all fail, the highest roll wins.
In ties, the player wins.
In ties between players, roll again between the tied parties only.

## Action Time

</Clip>

When it is useful to break down time into discrete chunks—during chases, fights, disasters, whatever—it breaks down into **moments** roughly `3` seconds long.

Characters can take one _action_ and one _reaction_ each moment without penalty.
They may **take an additional** _action_ or _reaction_ but make all tests at disadvantage or forego either their _action_ or _reaction_ to test the other with advantage.

_Actions_ include, but are not limited to:

- making an attack
- moving nearby
- applying a dweomer
- throwing a grappling hook
- drinking a potion
- using kit or tool

_Reactions_ include, but are not limited to, the following:

- parrying
- blocking
- dodging
- interfering with or aiding another action.

During action time use _Declare Up, Adjudicate Down_ (**DUAD**):

1. Everyone involved makes an opposed **Flax** test, noting their result and noting whether they triumphed, succeeded, or failed.
1. Actions and reactions are **declared from worst to best**--any reactions declared against an earlier action have advantage.
1. Action tests are **made in reverse of declaration**, last declared action being adjudicated first, reactions occurring as appropriate.

## Combat Reactions

</Clip>

Each of the combat reactions has particular tradeoffs:

- **Blocking** tests are made with advantage, sacrificing your shield to prevent injury.
- **Parrying** tests bat aside your opponents weapon, acting like light armor if you are unarmored or allowing you to re-roll your armor save otherwise.
- **Dodging** tests are made with disadvantage but negate injury if successful.

## Injury, Scarring, and Death

</Clip>

Combat is deadly and best avoided.
Characters can be hit `3` times before their luck runs out and they **Face Death**, making a test against **Bone**:

- **Triumph:** Character gains a **cool scar**.
- **Success:** Character gains a **wound**.
- **Failure:** Character gains a **terrible scar** and **2 wounds**.

Scars come in two flavors, _cool_ and _terrible_.
_Cool scars_ grant the character advantage on relevant social tests, _terrible scars_ impose disadvantage.

_Wounds_ permanently fill in one of the character's hit boxes, effectively reducing how many hits they can take in the future.

## Distance

</Clip>

Something is _close_ if you can reach out and touch it with no more than a few steps.

Something is _near_ if you can walk to it within a few seconds—within about 30 ft.

Something is _distant_ if it's further than nearby but still within about 150 ft.

Something is _far_ if it's further than distant but still visible.
