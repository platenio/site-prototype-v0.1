blurb: Hi there, my name is Dave. I'm a designer. Normally you preface the word designer with another word like graphic, UX, marketing, web, game, etc. I kind of gave up on figuring out which of those I am, so now I'm just a Designer.

Over the past ten years I went to college for graphic/web design, interned at some top local marketing/design firms, apprenticed under a master illustrator, spent two years working as a technical illustrator, and spent the past six years working as a design lead at a multi-billion dollar SAAS company. In 2019 I launched my first successful Kickstarter for a tabletop RPG supplement known as "A Rasp of Sand". Single-handedly writing, designing the mechanics, designing the layout, and handling a portion of the illustrations. So now I just call myself a designer.
